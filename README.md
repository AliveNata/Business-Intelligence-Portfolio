# Business-Intelligence-Portofolio
Welcome to my Business Intelligence portfolio. This portfolio is a collection of projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and dashboard creation that support data-driven decision making. Each project in this portfolio reflects my experience working with various data analysis tools, such as Looker, SQL, Formula and AppScript.

Through these projects, I have helped businesses identify important trends, optimize operations, and improve performance with data-driven insights. I believe that the ability to analyze and visualize data is key to creating effective and successful business strategies.
